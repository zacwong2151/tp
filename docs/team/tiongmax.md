### Project: iVolunteer

iVolunteer is an application for volunteer coordinators to manage volunteers, events, and their interactions. The user 
interacts with it using a CLI, with a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java with about 14 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Enhanced functionality for Event Delete command. [#89](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/pull/89).
  * Description: Delete event with index from the event list.
  * Highlights: The implementation itself is not too difficult but tedious due to the refactor of every related file
    including test cases.

* **New Feature**: Edit event detail feature [#113](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/pull/113).
  * Description: Edit the detail of an event.
  * Highlights: The implementation itself is not too difficult since it is adapted from AB3. However, for some parts like 
    start and end date, I have to figure it out myself on how to validate the update of start time and end time before
    editing the event. Other than that, it was tedious and challenging as I have to refactor the every file that are 
    related to this feature including test cases when our team decided to add on or remove fields from the command as 
    time goes on. [#221](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/pull/221).
