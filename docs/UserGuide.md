## Quick start

1. Ensure you have [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `iVolunteer.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for iVolunteer.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar iVolunteer.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `elist` : Lists all events

   * `ecreate n/food donation r/chef r/packer d/23/9/2023 1500 l/hougang dsc/help food distribution m/50 potatoes b/50.00` : Creates an event with name `food donation`, roles needed `chef` and `packer`, event date `23rd September 2023, 3pm`, description `help food distribution`, materials needed `50 potatoes` and budget `$50`

   * `edelete 3` : Deletes the 3rd event in the current event list

   * `vlist` : Lists all volunteers.

   * `vcreate n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com` : Adds a volunteer named `John Doe` to the list of volunteers.

   * `vdelete 3` : Deletes the 3rd volunteer in the current volunteer list.

   * `vclear` : Deletes all volunteers.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [s/SKILL]` can be used as `n/John Doe s/friendly` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[s/SKILL]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `s/friendly`, `s/friendly s/caring` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
